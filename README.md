# ENGN8536 Final Project "END TO END LEARNING FOR SELF DRIVING PLANE IN GTA V"
The aim of this project is to train a convolutional neural
network to automatically drive a plane in the game Grand
Theft Auto V to avoid crashing under the condition of low
altitude flight. A dataset is collected and processed and the
supervised learning method is adapted to train the CNN to
pilot the plane. We tune an architecture of a CNN in this
project and it is verified that the CNN is able to drive a
plane in GTA V .
